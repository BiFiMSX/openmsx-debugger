openMSX debugger
----------------

The openMSX debugger is a separate program that interfaces with
openMSX and controls its debugger from within a graphical user
interface.

* Requirements

The debugger requires the Qt4 GUI library to be installed.

A (reasonably) new CVS version of openMSX.

* Building

Set the variable QT_BASE in the file build/main.mk to point to 
correct Qt4 install directory.

Then build with:

make

* Installing

Install derived/bin/openmsx-debugger manually in any place you want.
