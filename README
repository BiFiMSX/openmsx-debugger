----------------
openMSX debugger
----------------

The openMSX debugger is a separate program that interfaces with
openMSX and controls its debugger from within a graphical user
interface.

* Requirements

The debugger requires the Qt4 GUI library to be installed.

Because the debugger communicates though the openMSX network
socket, openMSX should have the network socket enabled.

* Building

Build as follows:

qmake
make

* Installing

Install src/openmsx-debugger manually in any place you want.
