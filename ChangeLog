	* Implemented "make dist", which creates a source distribution tar.gz
	  archive in the directory "derived/dist".

2006-07-25 Edwin Velds <e.velds@gmail.com>
	* Added preliminary support for symbol tables.
	  Manual adding of symbols and loading of TNIASM symbol files are
	  implemented.

2006-06-14 Edwin Velds <e.velds@gmail.com>
	* Updated the connection dialog
	* Fixed a bug that caused a crash on closing openMSX

2006-05-13 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Added support for UI files in the new build system.
	* Got rid of the qmake build, since the generated UI headers in src/
	  were interfering with the new build system.
	  Make sure you get rid of the files generated by qmake; CVS will tell
	  you which files.

2006-05-12 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@scarlet.be>
	* Replaced connection code:
	   - this code _should_ also work on windows
	   - still work in progress

	* Got new build system working on OS X.

2006-04-14 Maarten ter Huurne <maarten@treewalker.org>
	* Made a build system similar to openMSX, on request of Edwin.
	  It's still in the early stages, but it can produce a working
	  executable on my system already.
	  To try it, edit build/main.mk and set QT_BASE correctly, then run:
	    make -f build/main.mk
	  This new build system does not interfere with the qmake build,
	  so we can use them side by side until the new system is mature.

2006-01-27 Edwin Velds <e.velds@gmail.com>
	* Updated to use the new "cpu" status update instead of
	  break/resume.

2005-12-26 Wouter Vermaelen <wouter.vermaelen@scarlet.be>
	* Use QTcpSocket iso winsock for TCP connections in windows:
	   - should now compile again on windows without manually hacking
	     the generated Makefiles
